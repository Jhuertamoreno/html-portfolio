<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am just beginning my programming journey. 
  With having learned some java, python, and currently learning web development,
   I hope to one day become a computer scientist/web dev.</p>

<p>Currently taking courses at Chemeketa community college seeking an associates transfer degree.
  I would like to pursue my bachelors in Computer Science at OSU, then would like to further my learning and go for a Masters degree.
